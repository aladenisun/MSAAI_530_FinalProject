    "This Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model is designed to learn and classify patterns in indoor air quality dynamics rather than identifying specific substances. Using time series data from three gas sensors along with temperature and humidity, the model captures how air conditions evolve over time during normal household activity and during events that degrade air quality, such as poor ventilation, cooking, or the presence of harmful gases. By modeling temporal dependencies, the LSTM can distinguish brief, harmless fluctuations from sustained or abnormal changes that may impact occupant health.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model runs in the cloud and processes incoming data in near real time, producing air quality state predictions that are smoothed over multiple windows before triggering alerts. Model performance is evaluated using classification metrics such as accuracy and F1-score, and results are visualized as predicted air quality states over time. \n"
